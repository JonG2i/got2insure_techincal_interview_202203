# Got2Insure Technical Interview - March 2022

In this folder you will find a simple C# project which will run on the .NET Core 5 framework.

The code is "correct" - as in, it will run if a few conditions (which are not given here) are met - but there are some shortcomings. Please review the code in `Program.cs` before the interview, with consideration for the following:

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Function
* Performance

In the interview we will review the code in your preference of Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code. If you have time, please ensure you can build the code before the interview. It is not necessary to fix any runtime exceptions you may encounter.
