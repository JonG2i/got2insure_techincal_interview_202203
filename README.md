# Got2Insure Technical Interview - March 2022

In this folder you will find a simple C# project which will run on the .NET Core 5 framework.

The code is "correct" - as in, it will run if a few conditions (which are not given here) are met - but there are some shortcomings. Please review the code in `Program.cs` before the interview, with consideration for the following:

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Function
* Performance

In the interview we will review the code in your preference of Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code.

You may build the code _if you wish_, but this is not required.

If you attempt to run the code, please do *not* spend time fixing any runtime exceptions you may encounter before the interview.
